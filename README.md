"Design for Games &amp; Play III" addresses the many ways in which play connects with daily life, with special attention to creating fun and meaningful experiences in real-life contexts. It touches upon how to analyze and use the dynamics of play to produce impactful experiences.

## The idea
Our idea is to have a treasure box somewhere on campus. Then a player will have to solve a puzzle to find the treasure. When the player finds the treasure, they'll get the option to trade the item that is in the box for another they bring themselves.

## The Application
This application is build on top of Node.Js together with Next.js, because of it's ease of use, web focused use cases and rich ecosystem.
