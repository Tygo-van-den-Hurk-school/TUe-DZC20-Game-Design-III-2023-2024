> This application is for Design for Games &amp; Play III, a course for the [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/). The project is still visible at [gamedesign3.school.tygo.van.den.hurk.dev](https://gamedesign3.school.tygo.van.den.hurk.dev/home) in a decommissioned state.

> [!NOTE]  
> Since the project is over, we took the raspberry pi back for other projects. Therefore the project has no backend and is considered "decommissioned". You can still view the final project [here](https://gamedesign3.school.tygo.van.den.hurk.dev/home), but it won't work anymore.

# TUe-DZC20-Game-Design-III-2023-2024
"Design for Games &amp; Play III" addresses the many ways in which play connects with daily life, with special attention to creating fun and meaningful experiences in real-life contexts. It touches upon how to analyze and use the dynamics of play to produce impactful experiences.

## The idea
Our idea is to have a treasure box somewhere on campus. Then a player will have to solve a puzzle to find the treasure. When the player finds the treasure, they'll get the option to trade the item that is in the box for another they bring themselves.

## The Application
This application is build on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), because of it's ease of use, web focused use cases and rich ecosystem together with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://react.dev/) for the fontend, and plain Javascript and [express](https://expressjs.com/).
