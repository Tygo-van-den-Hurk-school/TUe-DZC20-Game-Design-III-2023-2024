# CSS-Files
In this folder, we'll put all the CSS-Modules. CSS is used for styling the page. To get our CSS we'll compile SASS source code `.scss` files using the compiler into CSS.

> [!WARNING]  
> Changing the `.css` files not going to work. every time the compiler compiles the SASS it will override these files. Please change the `.scss` files in the `scss/` directory if you'd like to make changes.
