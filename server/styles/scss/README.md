# SCSS-Files
SASS Files or `.scss` files are used for styling pages. They are compiled to CSS so that the webbrowser can understand them.

SASS is a superset of CSS so all valid CSS is valid SCSS. Please change these files if you'd like to make changes and not the CSS files, as these will get overwritten on a new compile.
