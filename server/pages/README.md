# Pages
In this folder, we'll configure the pages that the site will display. The folder structure will translocate into the URL as well. So `{PWD}/server/pages/some/path/index.js` will be accessed by the URL `example.com/some/path`. The `index.js` file will be the file that Next.js takes the default export from and returns that as the page.
